## The Thirsty Students (Simply Drinks) Web Application

This project is a Node.js web application built with Express and EJS. The project is a drink shop called The Thirsty Students (I have named it Simply Drinks). The app uses EJS templates to display webpages and show data like the shop name and product list. It also includes forms that let users search for drinks and register their details. The project demonstrates how to create routes, display dynamic content, and handle both GET and POST form submissions.

## Technologies Used

Node.js - Running the Server with node.js

EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) – Templating engine used to generate dynamic HTML pages

Express Framework - Manages Routing requests

JavaScript - The Programming Language

HTML - Displays the Web Application in the Browser

CSS – Used to style the webpages
